## MVP Risk Mitigation Results - All Critical Risks Addressed

### âœ… [SEC-001]: Camera Permission - MITIGATED (9 â†’ 2)

**New Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Simple 3-state check reduces complexity
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Still privacy sensitive but well-controlled
**MVP Mitigation Applied**:
- Simple permission check: .notDeterminedâ†’request, .deniedâ†’Settings screen
- No session starts unless .authorized (enforced at camera initialization)
- Minimal state machine reduces error surface area
**Testing Simplified**: 3 paths only (allow, denyâ†’Settingsâ†’allow, denyâ†’stay denied)

### âœ… [DATA-001]: Image Memory - MITIGATED (9 â†’ 3)

**New Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Fixed compression eliminates variable memory usage
**Impact**: High (3) - Still could affect user experience if failed
**MVP Mitigation Applied**:

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Permission Security Tests**: Test all permission states, denial scenarios, Settings integration
- **Memory Stress Tests**: Load test with 20MB+ HEIC images, monitor memory usage
- **Image Processing Tests**: Validate â‰¤2MB constraint under all conditions
- **Camera Session Tests**: Device testing for session lifecycle, interruptions

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Performance Tests**: Measure image processing times, UI responsiveness
- **Device Testing Protocol**: Comprehensive manual testing on physical devices
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end flows with real camera/gallery operations
- **Background/Foreground Tests**: App lifecycle transition testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Navigation Flow Tests**: State persistence, AppState validation
- **Error Handling Tests**: Simulate failure conditions, validate error messages
- **UI/UX Tests**: Camera toggle clarity, user flow validation
- **Simulator Tests**: Comprehensive gallery-only path validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All critical risks (SEC-001, DATA-001)
- High-impact operational risk (OPS-001 - device testing)
- Performance blocking issues (PERF-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Medium risks with proper monitoring and error handling
- Technical complexity issues with documented workarounds
- UI/UX issues with user guidance

### Accepted Risks
- Low-probability SwiftUI edge cases (TECH-003)
- Minor storage cleanup issues (DATA-002) - can be addressed post-MVP

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Camera session errors**: Monitor AVFoundation error rates
- **Image processing failures**: Track resize operation success rates
- **Permission denial rates**: Monitor user permission grant/deny patterns
- **Memory usage**: Track peak memory during image operations
- **Performance metrics**: Image processing duration, UI responsiveness
- **Crash rates**: Especially around camera operations and image processing

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Camera integration approach changes (AVFoundation vs third-party)
- iOS version compatibility requirements change
- Image processing requirements evolve
- New device form factors are supported
- Privacy regulations change
- Performance benchmarks are established

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. **Device Testing First**: Establish physical device testing before simulator testing
2. **Permission Edge Cases**: Test all permission state combinations thoroughly
3. **Memory Stress Testing**: Use largest possible images to validate constraints
4. **Background Processing**: Validate camera session handling during interruptions

### Development Focus
1. **Permission Validation**: Multiple layers of permission checking
2. **Async Image Processing**: Background queues for all image operations
3. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with user guidance
4. **Session Management**: Robust camera session lifecycle handling

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Phased Rollout**: Start with photo library only, add camera gradually
2. **Feature Flags**: Toggle camera functionality independently
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Comprehensive camera and image processing metrics
4. **Rollback Plan**: Quick disable of camera features if critical issues arise
