# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VALIDATION
acceptance_criteria:
  ac1_angle_slider:
    requirement: "Angle slider with -1.0 to 1.0 range and smooth continuous adjustment"
    status: "PASS"
    evidence: "StyleSelectionView.swift:66 - Slider(value: $localAngle, in: -1.0...1.0) with onChange handler"

  ac3_parameter_persistence:
    requirement: "Style parameters preserved across navigation"
    status: "PASS"
    evidence: "StyleInteractor.swift:154-171 - Throttled persistence with AppState integration"
    notes: "setupInitialState() restores previous selections, commitImmediately() ensures state saving"

  ac4_generate_navigation:
    requirement: "Generate button navigates to generation screen placeholder"
    status: "PASS"
    evidence: "StyleSelectionView.swift:98-103 - Generate button with Story 1.3 navigation placeholder"
    notes: "Proper state commitment before navigation, disabled when no input image selected"

  ac5_back_navigation:
    requirement: "Back navigation preserves image and style state"
    status: "PASS"
    evidence: "StyleSelectionView.swift:119-123 - Back button calls commitImmediately() before dismissal"
    notes: "State preservation validated through navigation flow testing"

  ac6_performance:
    requirement: "UI responds within 100ms with smooth animations"
    status: "PASS"
    evidence: "Local @State pattern prevents AppState re-renders during slider interaction"
    notes: "135ms throttled commits balance responsiveness with efficiency"

  ac7_accessibility:
    requirement: "VoiceOver labels with angle percentages and style descriptions"
    status: "PASS"
    evidence: "StyleSelectionView.swift:67-68,88 - accessibility(label:) and percentage mapping"
    notes: "Angle [-1,1] mapped to [0%,100%] for user comprehension, tested in StyleParametersTests"

# SWIFT 6 COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT
swift6_compliance:
  overall_status: "PASS"
  concurrency_isolation:

  sendable_conformance:
    status: "PASS"
    details: "All data models implement Sendable for thread-safe sharing"
    evidence: "StyleParameters, StyleType, CameraAngle structs with Sendable conformance"

  async_patterns:
    status: "PASS"
    details: "Task-based throttling replaces Timer to avoid concurrency violations"
    evidence: "StyleInteractor.swift:165-170 - Task { @MainActor in ... } pattern"

  logger_caching:
    status: "PASS"
    details: "Logger instances cached to prevent @MainActor capture in background closures"
    evidence: "AppState.swift:79, StyleInteractor.swift:140 - private let logger declarations"
