# 15. Context7 Architecture Alignment

## API Design Standards
**Endpoint Structure (Epic 2):**
```
POST /api/generate
  Headers: Authorization: Bearer [JWT]
  Body: {
    image: base64_string,
    style: 1-6 (style number),
    userId: string
  }
  Response: {
    success: boolean,
    imageUrl?: string,
    error?: string,
    creditsRemaining?: number
  }
```

**Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "CREDITS_EXHAUSTED",
    "message": "You've used today's free photos",
    "userAction": "upgrade"
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Refresh tokens stored securely in Keychain (iOS)
- API keys never exposed in client code
- All API calls over HTTPS
- Input validation on both client and server

## Performance Optimization
- Image compression before upload (max 2MB)
- CDN for static assets (legal docs)
- Lazy loading for non-critical features
- Response caching for subscription status (5 min TTL)

## Monitoring & Observability
```
Required Metrics:
- API response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Generation success rate
- Credit usage patterns
- Error frequency by type
- User funnel conversion
```
